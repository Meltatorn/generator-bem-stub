`generator-bem-stub` is a generator of [BEM](http://bem.info/) projects for [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io).

## Introduction

There are several assemblers for [BEM](http://bem.info/) projects â€” [bem-tools](http://bem.info/tools/bem/bem-tools/) and [ENB](https://github.com/enb-make/enb). What does any developer do by starting a new [BEM](http://bem.info/) project? First and foremost, a developer creates a configuration file for an assembler which he is going to use. Unfortunately it is rather time-consuming and prone to error process both for [bem-tools](http://bem.info/tools/bem/bem-tools/) and [ENB](https://github.com/enb-make/enb).

In order to save time and decrease barrier to entry into the tools for assembly, we decided to create a generator of configuration files which allows a developer to configure the assembly without immersion into tools' **API**. This generator provides you the ability to get the base of [BEM](http://bem.info/) project in few minutes by answering the simple questions.

## Install

To install the generator run:

```bash
$ npm install -g generator-bem-stub
```

## Usage

Run:

```bash
$ yo bem-stub
```

To create the config file fitting for your project, the generator will ask several questions. Note that some of them depend on the previous ones, for example:

* If you have chosen library [bem-components](http://bem.info/libs/bem-components/current/), `generator-bem-stub` will choose [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) and CSS preprocessor [Stylus](https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus) as default.

* You can choose template engine [BH](https://github.com/enb-make/bh) only if you have chosen assembler [ENB](https://github.com/enb-make/enb).

* If you have not chosen technology [BEMJSON](http://bem.info/technology/bemjson/current/bemjson/), bundles will be assembled from [BEMDECL](http://bem.info/technology/bemjson/current/bemjson/).

* You can build HTML only if you have chosen technology [BEMJSON](http://bem.info/technology/bemjson/current/bemjson/) and template engine [BEMHTML](http://bem.info/technology/bemhtml/current/intro/) or [BH](https://github.com/enb-make/bh).

* You will be able to choose which separate files to minimize only if you have chosen assembler [ENB](https://github.com/enb-make/enb) ([bem-tools](http://bem.info/tools/bem/bem-tools/) does not support configuration of minimization, all possible files are minimized by [borschik](http://bem.info/tools/optimizers/borschik/)).

### Installation of dependencies

`generator-bem-stub` will install all dependencies and libraries after generation of the project.

If you do not want to install dependencies and libraries, use the option `--skip-install`:

```bash
$ yo bem-stub --skip-install
```

### Versions

You can check in the file [app/config/versions.js](https://github.com/bem/generator-bem-stub/blob/master/app/config/versions.js) which versions of the dependencies and libraries `generator-bem-stub` uses.
